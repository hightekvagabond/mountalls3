# S3 Bucket Mount Script

A bash script that automatically mounts Amazon S3 buckets as local filesystem directories using s3fs-fuse. Mount all your S3 buckets from all AWS profiles or selectively mount from specific profiles with customizable locations.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Profile Support**: Mount buckets from all AWS profiles or select specific profiles
- **Custom Mount Locations**: Override the default `~/s3` mount directory
- **Smart Bucket Handling**: Automatically handles buckets with dots in names and different regions
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Detects and skips already mounted buckets
- **Easy Unmounting**: Simple command to unmount all S3 buckets at once
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Automatic checks for required tools and configuration

## üìã Prerequisites

The script automatically checks for these requirements and provides installation instructions if missing:

1. **s3fs-fuse** - FUSE-based file system for S3
2. **AWS CLI** - Amazon Web Services command line interface
3. **AWS Credentials** - Properly configured AWS profiles with access keys

### Quick Installation

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install s3fs awscli
```

**CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install s3fs-fuse awscli
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install s3fs awscli
```

**Configure AWS:**
```bash
aws configure
# OR for multiple profiles:
aws configure --profile myprofile
```

## üîß Installation

1. **Download the script:**
   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/mounts3.sh
   # OR
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/mounts3.sh
   ```

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x mounts3.sh
   ```

3. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   ./mounts3.sh
   ```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Mount all buckets from all AWS profiles (default behavior)
./mounts3.sh

# Mount buckets from a specific profile only
./mounts3.sh -p my-work-profile

# Mount to a custom location instead of ~/s3
./mounts3.sh -m /mnt/s3

# Combine profile and custom location
./mounts3.sh -p production -m /production/s3

# Unmount all S3 buckets
./mounts3.sh --unmount

# Show help
./mounts3.sh --help
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `(no options)` | Mount all buckets from all AWS profiles to `~/s3` |
| `-p, --profile PROFILE` | Mount buckets from specific AWS profile only |
| `-m, --mount-base PATH` | Override default mount location |
| `-u, --unmount, unmount` | Unmount all S3 buckets |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |

### Examples

**Mount everything:**
```bash
./mounts3.sh
```

**Work with specific environments:**
```bash
# Mount only production buckets
./mounts3.sh -p production

# Mount development buckets to a specific location
./mounts3.sh -p development -m /dev/s3

# Mount personal buckets to home directory
./mounts3.sh -p personal -m ~/personal-s3
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Unmount everything
./mounts3.sh --unmount
```

## üîÑ Automation

### Crontab (Auto-mount on reboot)

Add to your crontab to automatically mount S3 buckets on system startup:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line:
```bash
@reboot /path/to/mounts3.sh > /path/to/mounts3.log 2>&1
```

### Systemd Service (Advanced)

For more robust startup handling, you can create a systemd service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/s3-mount.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mount S3 Buckets
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=yourusername
ExecStart=/path/to/mounts3.sh
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable s3-mount.service
sudo systemctl start s3-mount.service
```

## üîí Security Notes

- The script creates temporary password files (`~/.aws/passwd-s3fs-PROFILE`) with 600 permissions
- AWS credentials are read from your existing `~/.aws/credentials` file
- Consider using AWS IAM roles or temporary credentials for enhanced security
- Never commit AWS credentials to version control

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
# Make sure you have proper AWS permissions for the buckets
aws s3 ls --profile yourprofile

# Check if s3fs has proper permissions
ls -la ~/.aws/passwd-s3fs-*
```

**Mount Failures:**
```bash
# Run s3fs manually with debug info
s3fs your-bucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=~/.aws/passwd-s3fs-profile -o dbglevel=info -f
```

**Bucket Not Accessible:**
- Verify your AWS credentials have access to the bucket
- Check if the bucket exists and you have the correct permissions
- Ensure your AWS profile is properly configured

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting mount issues, the script provides debug commands in its error messages. Run them to get detailed information about what's failing.
